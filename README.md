# ghjk

ghjk (jk) is a programmable runtime manager.

## Features

- install and manage tools (e.g. rustup, deno, node, etc.)
  - fuzzy match the version
  - support dependencies between tools
- setup runtime helpers (e.g. pre-commit, linting, ignore, etc.)
  - provide a general regex based lockfile
  - enforce custom rules
- create aliases and shortcuts
  - `meta` -> `cargo run -p meta`
  - `x meta` -> `cargo run -p meta` (avoid conflicts and provide autocompletion)
- load environment variables and prompt for missing ones
- define build tasks with dependencies
  - `task("build", {depends_on: [rust], if: Deno.build.os === "Macos" })`
  - `task.bash("ls")`
- compatible with continuous integration (e.g. github actions, gitlab)

## Getting started

Install the hooks:

```bash
deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metatypedev/ghjk/main/install.ts
```

In your project, create a configuration file `ghjk.ts`:

```ts
export { ghjk } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metatypedev/ghjk/main/mod.ts";

node({ version: "14.17.0" });
```

## How it works

The only required dependency is `deno`. Everything else is managed automatically
and looks as follows (abstracting away some implementation details):

- the installer sets up a directory hook in your shell profile
  - `.bashrc`
  - `.zshrc`
  - `.config/fish/config.fish`
- for every visited directory, the hook looks for `$PWD/ghjk.ts` in the
  directory or its parents, and
  - adds the `$HOME/.local/share/ghjk/shims/$PWD` to your `$PATH`
  - sources environment variables in `$HOME/.local/share/ghjk/shims/$PWD/loader`
    and clear previously loaded ones (if any)
  - defines an alias `ghjk` running `deno run -A $PWD/ghjk.ts`
- you can then
  - sync your runtime with `ghjk sync` which
    - installs the missing tools at `$HOME/.local/share/ghjk/installs`
    - regenerates the shims with symlinks and environment variables
    - detects any violation of the enforced rules
  - `ghjk list`: list installed tools and versions
  - `ghjk outdated`: list outdated tools
  - `ghjk cleanup`: remove unused tools and versions

## Extending `ghjk`

```ts
```

## todo

- multiple version of the same package (e.g. rust stable and rust nightly)
- wasmedge
- python with virtual env dir
- poetry
- pnpm
- mold({ if: Deno.build.os === "Macos" })
- hash verifiable dependencies (timestamp)
