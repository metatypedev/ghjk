Ghjk is made up of a set of modules that each implement and encapsulate a set of
related features. The program is primarily consumed through the provided CLI. It
takes as an argument a path to a ghjkfile (through `$GHJKFILE`) and if no such
argument is provided, it'll look for a file named `ghjk.ts` in the current or
any of the parent directories and treat it as the config file. It then loads the
config file in a `WebWorker` to obtain a config object which is expected to
contain configuration for any of the modules it's interested in. The modules
then process their configuration and, based on it, outline the cli commands and
flags to expose through the CLI. The modules are also allowed to export entries
to the lockfile which is treated as a _memo_ of the processed config file. As of
January 1, 2024 the following modules are implemented/planned:

- Ports: download and install executables and libraries
- Envs: make CLI shell environments that have access to specific programs and
  variables
- Tasks: run commands in custom shell environments

## Run down

Ghjk is composed of two distinct spheres:

- The ghjkfile
  - Currently, only `ghjk.ts` files are supported
  - produces a config object that configure the different modules
- The host
  - loads and processes config files

Ghjkfiles are the primary entry point for interacting with `ghjk` and provide
the vector of programmability for end users. As of today, only `ghjk.ts` config
files are supported but the `ghjk` is designed to support alternatives. You'll
observe that this kind of modularity and extendability is a core motif of the
design, providing constraints, guidance and tension that's informed a lot of the
current design. A lot of decisions and abstractions will thus appear YAGNI (you
ain't going to need it) at this early stage but programmability is the name of
the game in ghjk so we prefer to err on the side of modularity.

### Ghjkfiles

#### `ghjk.ts`

- They're loaded in a `WebWorker` (Deno flavoured) with access limited to:
  - `--allow-read=$PWD`
  - `--allow-net=*`
  - `--allow-env=*`
  - `--allow-sys=*`
- `ghjk.ts` is expected to expose a `getConfig` function
- `getConfig` is expected to return a `Promise<SerializedConfig>` type
  - If `ghjk.ts` exposes an item named `secureConfig`, it's passed as the first
    argument to `getConfig`.
- `ghjk/mod.ts` exposes a bunch of helpers for authoring conventional `ghjk.ts`
  but as far as the host is concerned, it's only aware of the
  `getConfig(ghjkfileUrl, secureConfig?): SerializedConfig` interface.

### Ghjkdir

- Contains files specific to a certain ghjkfile
- Expected and placed in `.ghjk/` within the same dir of the ghjkfile.
- Contents:
  - `lock.json`: lockfile generated from the ghjkfile. Intended to be version
    control.
  - `deno.lock`: lockfile for any modules used by ghjk when working with that
    specific lockfile. Intended to be version controlled.
  - `hash.json`: serves as a store for hashes used to determine weather
    re-serialization is necessary. Don't put in version control.
  - `envs`: the shims and loaders of the different environments

### Host

The host is the section of the program expected to:

- Provide the `ghjk` CLI
- Load and serialize config files
- Load and drive the modules according CLI arguments and config object
- Lockfile management

### Modules

Ghjk is made up of a set of interacting modules implementing specific
functionality. Listed below are the modules that we think will make ghjk a
complete runtime manager but note that we don't currently plan on implementing
all of them. Getting each module to become competitive with equivalent tools let
alone achieving feature parity is beyond the resources available to the authors
today and their design is only considered here to provide a holistic perspective
for the design of ghjk. It is, after all, a _programmable runtime manager_ and
we intend to make the core of ghjk (i.e. the host) modular enough that:

- Future implementations shouldn't require large refactors
- Easy integration of external tools as modules
- Easy to swap implementation of modules without requiring lot of changes in
  other dependent modules

#### Ports module

Equivalent tools:

- [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- [`rtx`](https://github.com/jdx/rtx)
- [`proto`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto)
- [`nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) and especially so the
  [flakes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/) feature.

- The ports module handles the download and installation of os level programs
  and libraries.
  - Executables, shared libraries, header files, documentation (TODO) are all in
    scope.
  - Installations are put in a central location and are shared across all the
    ghjk environments that make use of them.
- The config for the ports module expects:
  - `allowedPortDeps`: the list of ports other ports are allowed to depend on at
    build time.
    - Including the default `InstallConfig` to use for the dependency port if
      not specified by dependents.
  - `installs`: a list of `InstallConfig` objects describing the installations
    to provide.
    - Each `InstallConfig` will contain a `PortManifest` describing the `Port`
      program that will handle it's installation.
      - A `PortManifest` can optionally specify a list of other ports, under
        `buildDeps`, that the `Port` requires during build time.
        - A separate list of dependencies, `resolutionDeps`, is used for version
          resolution like `listAll` and `latestStable`.
      - Any dependencies used by ports must be declared in the top level
        `allowedPortDeps` list.
        - I.e. non standard dependencies will have to be manually declared there
          by users.
    - `InstallConfig` can optionally contain a `version` field.
      - If found, the `version` is sanity checked against the list of versions
        returned by `listAll`.
        - [ ] Fuzzy matching can optionally take place.
      - If not found, the `latestStable` version routine of the `Port` is
        invoked to obtain the version.
    - `InstallConfig` can optionally specify `InstallConfig`s to be used by the
      dependency ports.
      - If provided, will override the default from the top level
        `allowedPortDeps`.
    - [ ] runtime deps

##### Port implementation reference

- A Port is described through the `PortManifest` object.
- The implementation and execution of ports depends on the `ty` of the port but
  they're all, roughly, expected to expose the following stages modeled after
  `asdf` plugins:
  - `listAll`: return a list of all the versions that the port
  - `latestStable`: the version to install when no version is specified by the
    user.
  - `download`: fetch distribution files into a provided dir
    - Any archives are preferably extracted prior to placement in download dir
  - `install`: build, process, transform the downloaded files in any way
    required to create the final artifacts.
    - Artifacts are placed into the installDir
      - [ ] Consider hiding the final install directory from ports
  - `execEnv`: list of environment variables required by users of exposed
    artifacts
  - `listBinPaths`: list of executables to expose in the environment. Globs are
    expanded.
  - `listLibPaths`: list of shared libraries to expose in the environment. Globs
    are expanded.
  - `listIncludePaths`: list of header files to expose in the environment. Globs
    are expanded.
  - [ ] `listManPaths`: list of manual files to expose in the environment. Globs
        are expanded.

###### `denoWorker@v1` ports

- EcmaScript file at `moduleSpecifier` is `import`ed within a `WebWorker`.
  - It must export a `PortBase` class implementation under the name `Port`.
- Module will have limited deno permissions:
  - `-allow-run=execs-of-build-deps` on the `download` and `install` stages.
  - `-allow-run=execs-of-resolution-deps` on the `listAll` and `latestStable`
    stages.
  - `-allow-read=installDir,downloadDir` on all stages.

###### `ambientAccess@v1` ports

- Formally way of accessing tools already globally present on the system.
- Look at `AmbientAccessPortManifest` for what configuration is
  required/available.

#### Envs module

Reproducible CLI shell environments that can access specific tools and
variables. Including support to auto-load an environment when a specific shell
`cd`'s to the ghjk root.
